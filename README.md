# SocialNetworkAPI

# Description
This is a Rest API designed to be the backend for a social media app. I built this using Express, Mongoose ODM and MongoDB. It was excellent practice with the relational mapping capabilities of MongoDB. To install this app just run npm i and then npm start. Next use your browser or an app like Insomnia to test the API!
